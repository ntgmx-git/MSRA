## Prerequisites
These elements must be available to follow this guide.
- Two accessible IPs - one for the Apache Guacamole server and one other for your back-to-machines router (it will may be your ISP router). Also depending on your setup you will may need some domain names or DynDNS domain names to ensure the reachability of these devices. There are some free options available. 
- A router capable of firwalling / manage wireguard "server" instance - it could be the same than your back-to-machine router 
- One container / VM / device to play the role of the reached machine through Apache Guacamole 


## RFC
I am always in research of comment about this kind of work. If you want to describe issues, alternative, update or anything else please feel free to comment. The idea of not giving a fully automated script is also to ensure at least some people will run into the full configuration - and then "review" it in some manner.

Anyway, good reading and thanks in advance for your returns.
